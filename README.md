# CatWatcher
CatWatcher monitors the Oregon Human Society website and sends email notifications whenever a new cat is put up for adoption. Kitties get adopted almost instantly and this will help get there quicker and compete.

The website is a bit tricky because it uses javascript to dynamically load the cat content

Pray I get a kitten
